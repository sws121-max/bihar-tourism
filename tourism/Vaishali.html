			<h2>Location</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Vaishali is situated in the eastern Indian state of Bihar, around 55 km off Patna, the capital of the state. Vaishali extends from latitude 25° in the North to longitude 85° in the East. The town, an important place for both the Buddhists and Jains, is well connected to other important cities in Bihar by road.</p>
				</section>
				<section style="height:auto;">
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">Believed to be the first republic in the world, Vaishali has taken its name from King Vishal of the Mahabharat age. He is said to have constructed a great fort here, which is now in ruins. Vaishali is a great Buddhist pilgrimage and also the birthplace of Lord Mahavira. It is said that the Buddha visited this place thrice and spent quite a long time here. The Buddha also delivered his last sermon at Vaishali and announced his Nirvana here. After his death, Vaishali also held the second Buddhist Council.</p><br>
			<p style="text-align:justify;">The great Lichchavi clan ruled Vaishali in the sixth century BC, and the empire extended up to the hills of Nepal. The Lichchavi state is considered to be the first republican state of Asia. According to the Jataka stories, (Buddhist story books giving the account of different births of the Buddha), Vaishali was ruled by some 7707 kings of the Lichchavi clan. Ajatshatru, the great Magadh King, annexed Vaishali in the fifth century BC and after that Vaishali gradually lost its glory and power.Mahavira, the last Tirthankar of Jainism, was born in Kundupur near Vaishali. The father of Mahavira was King Siddartha and his mother Trishala was the sister of King Chetaka of Vaishali. Since the wealth of his father's kingdom had increased during the pregnancy, the child was called Vardhaman. He was named Mahavira because he showed great courage in a very young age. After the death of his parents at the age of 30, he renounced the world after fasting for two days under an Ashoka tree in Vaishali.</p><br>

			<h2>Tourist Attractions</h2>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">Kolhua is the first important place when one starts exploring Vaishali.

               <p style="text-align:justify;">The Vaishali Museum is a great place for the tourists interested in archeology.

Close to the museum is a circular tin shed covering the remnants of the stupa, which once housed the Buddha's funeral ashes.</p><br>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">At one side of the museum is the Abhishek Pushkarani or the coronation tank of the Lichchavi's. A little distance away is Raja Vishal Ka Garh, an excavated site believed to be the remains of the ancient parliament house where the federal assembly of the Lichchavi government gathered to discuss and regulate the ancient republic.</p><br>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">The Bawan Pokhar Temple, built during the Pala period, stands on the northern bank of a tank known as Bawan Pokhar and enshrines beautiful images of several Hindu gods.</p><br>
               <p style="text-align:justify;">A major attraction in Vaishali is the Vishwa Shanti Stupa (pillar of peace), one of the newest additions to this important site. This monument, built on the south bank of the coronation tank, is one of the highest in the world and has been built in collaboration with the Japanese government.</p><br>
